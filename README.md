# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for computer vision
CNN is a type of deep learning neural network that is very effective at computer vision. This repository will be a group of small projects regarding CNN for Computer vision using Keras and Tensorflow


### Keras Applications - Static Images
> Keras Applications are deep learning models that are made available alongside pre-trained weights. These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning - [Source](https://keras.io/api/applications/)
